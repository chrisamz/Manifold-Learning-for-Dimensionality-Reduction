# Manifold Learning for Dimensionality Reduction

## Description

This project focuses on implementing manifold flattening and reconstruction methods for dimensionality reduction and visualization of high-dimensional data. The goal is to explore advanced techniques in manifold learning to effectively reduce the dimensionality of data while preserving its intrinsic structure, enabling better visualization and analysis.

## Skills Demonstrated

- **Manifold Learning:** Techniques to discover the low-dimensional structure embedded in high-dimensional data.
- **Dimensionality Reduction:** Methods to reduce the number of random variables under consideration.
- **Data Visualization:** Techniques to visualize high-dimensional data in a lower-dimensional space.

## Use Case

- **Genomics:** Visualizing gene expression data to identify patterns and clusters.
- **Image Processing:** Reducing the dimensionality of image data for compression and feature extraction.
- **Anomaly Detection:** Identifying outliers and anomalies in high-dimensional datasets.

## Components

### 1. Data Collection and Preprocessing

Collect and preprocess high-dimensional data to ensure it is clean, consistent, and ready for analysis.

- **Data Sources:** Genomic datasets, image datasets, sensor data.
- **Techniques Used:** Data cleaning, normalization, feature extraction, handling missing data.

### 2. Manifold Learning

Implement manifold learning techniques to reduce the dimensionality of the data.

- **Techniques Used:** Isomap, Locally Linear Embedding (LLE), t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE).
- **Libraries/Tools:** scikit-learn, umap-learn.

### 3. Dimensionality Reduction

Apply dimensionality reduction methods to transform the data into a lower-dimensional space.

- **Techniques Used:** Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Independent Component Analysis (ICA), Singular Value Decomposition (SVD).

### 4. Data Visualization

Visualize the reduced-dimensionality data to understand its structure and patterns.

- **Techniques Used:** Scatter plots, 3D plots, heatmaps.
- **Libraries/Tools:** matplotlib, seaborn, plotly.

### 5. Evaluation and Validation

Evaluate the performance of the manifold learning and dimensionality reduction methods using appropriate metrics.

- **Metrics Used:** Explained variance, reconstruction error, visualization quality.
